# 🪔 Sumiran — सुमिरन

> *Remembrance of God through repetition*

**Sumiran** is a beautiful, offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking your daily chanting (Jaap) practice. Built with devotion for sadhaks who wish to keep a faithful record of their spiritual discipline.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Today Card** — Enter your daily Jaap count and notes. Pre-populates if you've already saved today.
- **Reflection Card** — See your lifetime total, current year total, milestone progress, predicted completion date, and full milestone history.
- **Ledger** — A complete history of your practice, grouped by year. Sundays highlighted in crimson. Editable within 7 days.
- **Milestones** — Every Crore (1,00,00,000) is celebrated with the date achieved and days since the previous milestone.
- **Prediction** — Based on your 30-day average, Sumiran predicts when you'll reach your next Crore.
- **Sankalpa Layer** — A single, sacred, immutable record of the intent with which your sādhanā began. Not a goal. A remembrance.
- **Import** — Bring in years of past data from a JSON or CSV file.
- **Export** — Download your complete data as JSON or CSV backup anytime.
- **Colour Palettes** — Three devotional themes: Midnight Sanctum, Sacred Saffron, Forest Ashram.

## 🕯️ Sankalpa Layer

> *Ledgers count effort. Sankalpa anchors intent.*

Most spiritual apps track what you did. Sumiran also preserves why you began.

The Sankalpa Layer is a single sacred record — set once, enduring always — that lives quietly behind the ledger. It records:

- **Sankalpa text** — your vow of intent, in your own words
- **Context** — Guru, Devatā, or occasion (optional)
- **Date of Sankalpa** — automatically recorded, never editable

It is not shown loudly. It does not alter any count or progress bar. It simply holds the foundation of your practice — the way a monastery keeps its founding vow, or a lineage preserves its initiation records.

Changing a Sankalpa requires deliberate confirmation — a moment of pause that mirrors the gravity of rewriting a vow.
